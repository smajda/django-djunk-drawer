There are many Django helper collections, but this one is mine.

Much of this is a collection of random snippets from djangosnippets.org or stackoverflow answers. Credit given where credit due in doc strings. Everything else is licensed...oh, let's just say [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

    pip install -e git+git@github.com:smajda/django-djunk-drawer.git@master#egg=djunk_drawer
